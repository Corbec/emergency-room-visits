Executive Summary
Explore emergency department healthcare spending in the US using the data found on the Global Health Data Exchange. This data is aggregated by age ranges and the diagnosis group that the visit was for. I would also like to bring in historic healthcare spending by country to compare US healthcare spending with other countries and projected healthcare spending to look for any trends.

Motivation
I have chosen this subject because I work in healthcare analytics and the topic interests me. I feel the analysis may be useful to me professionally.
Data Question
How has healthcare spending in the US changed over time and how much of that spending is in emergency departments.

Some people tend to use emergency departments when they don’t have a primary care physician. I have done this in the past myself. I’m curious to see what proportion of patients are paying out of pocket versus using insurance. I’m also interested in exploring what conditions people are going to the ER for.

The same ED spending data was used to publish this paper: 

Woody Scott K, Liu A, Chen C, Kaldjian AS, Sabbatini AK, Duber, HC, Dieleman JL. Healthcare Spending in
U.S. Emergency Departments by Health Condition, 2006-2016. PLOS One. 27 October 2021

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
A dashboard or series of pages that will allow the user to select different geographic locations to compare spending, different demographics for emergency department spending (age/condition) and visualize how healthcare and ED spending may look in the future.
